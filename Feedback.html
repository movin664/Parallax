                "My wife fell in love with this painting after seeing a post on Instagram. I knew I had found the perfect birthday gift for her! I reached out to Nirosh 
                and asked him to reserve it for me. I requested that he frame the painting, which he did within a week. I'm very satisfied with the prompt service and my wife
                simply adores her gift!"

            <div class="feedback">"Absolutely brilliant - you managed to portray Kobe's emotions and intricate details so well, it felt as if I was staring at a photograph. 
                I'm a huge fan of your work, and I had no doubts about how great it's going to be. But seeing it for the first time, left me speechless. 
                I cannot thank you enough for taking the effort for creating this amazing piece of art. For me, it's priceless. "

                "This art gallery is truly incredible. Looking at all their jaw dropping artwork just makes you feel alive! I was amazed by all the beautiful pieces they had, 
                just in pure awe. I felt absolutely no pressure to buy and was shown several extra pieces not on the wall. I look forward to visiting this art gallery, 
                bringing others to look with me and of course to buy from them. I highly recommend this art gallery. Hands down an amazing experience as soon as you walk in the door."
